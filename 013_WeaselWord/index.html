<p id="texte">L.V. Anderson writes in Slate that the reported 53 percent of white women voters who voted for President-elect Donald Trump “sold out the sisterhood and the world” for mostly racist reasons.

From Slate:

According to CNN, 53 percent of most white female voters voted for Donald Trump. Fifty-three percent. More than half of white women voted for the man who bragged about committing sexual assault on tape, who said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, who has promised to undo legislation that has afforded health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans, whose parental leave plan is a joke, who has spent his campaign dehumanizing nonwhite people, who has spent 30-plus e public eye reducing women to their sexual attributes. More than half of whn looked at the first viable female candidate for the presidency, a wildly competent and overqualified career public servant, and said, “Trump that bitch.”

What leads a woman to vote for a man who has made it very clear that he believes she is subhuman? Self-loathing. Hypocrisy. And, of course, a racist view of the world that privileges white supremacy over every other issue.

…

Of course, the biggest and saddest reason white women chose Trump over Clinton is simple: racism. Trump tried to pit straight white men against everyone else—women, people of color, people in the LGBTQ commu, immigrants—and white women decided they didn’t want to vote on t of “everyone else.” They wanted to vote on the side of white men. White women decided that defending their position of power as white people was more important than reproductive rights, their sexual autonomy, their access to health care, family leave, and child care. White women into Trump’s lies about immigrant rapists and decided they’d rather have the respect of their angry white fathers, brothers, and husbands than the respect of literally everyone else in the world.

…

White women sold out their fellow women, their country, and themselves last night. Most white women don’t want to be part of an intersectional feminist sisterhood. Most white women just want to be one of the guys. And we will all suffer for it.</p>
