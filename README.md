# Finding Weasel Words
A Firefox extension that finds and animates the weasel words contained in any webpage. 

## Description of the project
Numerically vague expressions, adverbs that weaken, use of passive voice... Politicians and journalists can use a lot of these writing techniques to make their intention more attractive, less disturbing. 

The purpose of Finding Weasel Words is to allow people to become more aware of those equivocal words. 

See the wiki for more info on [how the text analysis work](https://github.com/mathildebuenerd/weaselwords/wiki/Text-analysis).
