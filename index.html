<p id="texte">L.V. Anderson writes in Slate that the reported 53 percent of white women voters who voted for President-elect Donald Trump “sold out the sisterhood and the world” for mostly racist reasons.

From Slate:

According to CNN, 53 percent of most white fle was more important than defending their reproductive rights, their sexual autonomy, their access to health care, family leave, and child care. White women bought into Trump’s lies about immigrant rapists and decided they’d rather have the respect of their angry white fathers, brothers, and husbands than the respect of literally everyone else in the world.

…

White women sold out their fellow women, their country, and themselves last night. Most white women don’t want to be part of an intersectional feminist sisterhood. Most white women just want to be one of the guys. And we will all suffer for it.</p>
